# Supervisor-School Assignment System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a school assignment system that allows supervisors to only access schools that have been specifically assigned to them through a junction table relationship.

## Database Schema Required

You need to create the following tables in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Schools table (should already exist)
CREATE TABLE schools (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    address TEXT, -- Optional field
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- Junction table for supervisor-school assignments
CREATE TABLE supervisor_schools (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    supervisor_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    school_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES schools(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    assigned_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE(supervisor_id, school_id)
);

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_supervisor_schools_supervisor_id ON supervisor_schools(supervisor_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_supervisor_schools_school_id ON supervisor_schools(school_id);
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Repository Updates
File: `lib/core/repositories/maintenance_count_repository.dart`

#### Enhanced Methods:
- **getMaintenanceSchools()**: Now fetches only schools assigned to the current supervisor
- **getAllSchools()**: Fetches all schools in the system (for admin purposes)
- **getUnassignedSchools()**: Fetches schools not assigned to the current supervisor
- **assignSchoolToSupervisor()**: Assigns a school to the current supervisor
- **unassignSchoolFromSupervisor()**: Removes school assignment

### 2. UI Updates
File: `lib/presentation/screens/maintenance_schools_screen.dart`

#### Changes Made:
- Updated app bar subtitle to reflect assigned schools
- Updated empty state messages to indicate no assigned schools

### 3. Automatic Integration
The system automatically integrates with existing functionality:
- Maintenance count forms only show assigned schools
- All existing maintenance count creation/editing continues to work
- Photo upload functionality preserved

## Usage Instructions

### For Supervisors:
1. Navigate to "حصورات الاعداد" (Maintenance Count) section
2. Only schools assigned to you will appear in the list
3. Select a school to proceed with maintenance count form
4. Complete the form as usual with all existing features

### For Database Setup:
Execute the SQL schema above in your Supabase database before the system will work properly.

## Security & Benefits

- Each supervisor only sees their assigned schools
- Built on existing authentication system
- Clean separation between schools and assignments
- Scalable and maintainable solution

The core functionality is now complete and ready for production use!
